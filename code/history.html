                <h2>"Excelsior"</h2>
                <p>December 28, 1922-November 12, 2018 </p>
                <p>New York, New York</p>
                <p>Stan Lee is a prominent co-creator of Marvel Comics. He was born Stanley Martin Lieber and spent some of his childhood during the Great Depression. Soon after beginning his career as a writer, he changed his name to "Lee". He was hired at Timely Comics in 1939 and edited for the company during the 1940s. During World War II, he worked as a writer and illustrator. Lee is most notable for co-creating the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Thor. Later in the 1960s, Timely Comics changed their name to Marvel Comics and Lee was tasked with creating a new series to compete with DC Comics' Justice League of America.</p>
                <p>Looking for inspiration from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne, he deviated from the traditional superhero and co-created the Fantastic Four with artist Jack Kirby in 1961. The other Marvel characters soon followed. The popularity of the characters grew, in part, due to their humanity and personable traits. The comics addressed real-life issues such as bigotry and drug use, which define the world of comics to this day.
                </p>
                <p>Eventually, Lee was promoted to editorial director and publisher in 1972. While serving as chairman emeritus, he saw his comics develop into the worldwide phemomenon that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He went on to receive a Medal of Arts honor from President George W. Bush. He has made a cameo in every Marvel franchise movie until his unfortunate demise on November 12, 2018. </p>
